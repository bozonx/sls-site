Thank you for your support, friend! Material expression of support is our way
of changing the world - we help good ideas and projects develop, so
we contribute to the development of the world for the better.

This is an expression of our personal foreign policy and struggle, thanks to which we ourselves
are making the world a little better right now and do not expect that someone
will change it for us sometime. We are doing this ourselves and right now, together, you and I,
we are making our important contribution to our common future.

Sincerely, Ivan K.
